# Mages Capstone
This is the final capstone project the was done during my time with Mages

The aim of this project is to predict the age of these mud crab based on the features in the data frame and provide the best possible time to harvest them.

I've created a fictatious company called Crustaceans Pte Ltd and gave it some restriction to simulate a real life business problem and how to solve them using analytical findings

If done properly, Crustacenas could minimize overhead cost and maximise the profit because mud crabs do not increase in length, diameter etc after hitting a specific age range.

This is a regression model problem and Ive used several Machine Learning Algorithm to get the best result after removing the outliers and hypertuning the models.

Ive gone ahead and created my first presentation in Tableu along with my findings and conclusions.
